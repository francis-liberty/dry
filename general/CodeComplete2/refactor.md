# Refactoring
## when to refactor
* duplicated code
* routine too long
* loop too long or too nested
* class has poor cohesion
* A class interface does not provide a consistent level of abstraction
* A parameter list has too many parameters
* Changes require parallel modifications to multiple classes
* Inheritance hierarchies have to be modified in parallel
* Comments are used to explain difficult code
* Global variables are used
* A program contains code that seems like it might be needed someday
